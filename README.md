# C# SFML - Raycaster

This is a test to see if I could create a simple game engine using SFML.

The idea is that this will become a raycasting engine (see https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) in the same vein as Wolfenstein 3D/Doom.

## Software used
- .Net 5.0
- SFML.NET

## Engine documentation
Tell future me to write this once the engine actually works
